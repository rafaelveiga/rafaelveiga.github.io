    Gamers Club Media is a network of multiple esports websites (DRAFT5.gg, VALORANTZone.gg, TropaFreeFire.com.br)<br />

    This endeavor started on Jan/2017, where I created DRAFT5.gg as a side project. In the following years, DRAFT5.gg grew to be the largest CS:GO focused esports website in Latin America.<br />
    <br />
    In Jun/2019, DRAFT5 was acquired by Gamers Club and Immortals Gaming Club. This has allowed me to pursue the development of DRAFT5 full-time in a multiple hat role working as fullstack developer and product designer<br />
    <br />
    Together with Gamers Club, we’ve expanded our operation to two more websites and a team of more than 20 professionals working for our network.<br />
